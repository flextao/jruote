
This example shows you how to create an active record based ruote engine with JRuote.
The java code is not fully completed for keeping it simple.
The Entity class is a business entity, which may means anything you want in your
business process.

In this example, we use Entity#id as storeName of ArWorkitem, for processing the entity
to keep process move on.
Ruote-web2 shows you another strategy to process the storeName and processes, please
read it for farther understanding how storeName and participant works.

Little more background info, this example is extracted from my working project, which
uses Google Guice as dependency injection framework and Hibernate as persistence framework.
